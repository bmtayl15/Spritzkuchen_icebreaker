Once upon a time there was a giraffe named Gerald. Gerald was reeeaallllly craving some bratwurst.
He realized, he was in the Haupstrasse of Germany.
Gerald arrived in the nearest Airport(Flughafen) to Raesfeld, then rented a BMW and drove to Eltz Castle(Schloss) and from there change his car for a Porche and drove to Berlin to watch Rammstein live at a Beer Garden (Bierd garden).
