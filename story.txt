Once upon a time there was a giraffe named Gerald. Gerald was reeeaallllly craving some bratwurst.
He realized, he was in the Haupstrasse of Germany.
Gerald arrived in the nearest Airport(Flughafen) to Raesfeld, then rented a BMW and drove to Eltz Castle(Schloss) and from there change his car for a Porche and drove to Berlin to watch Rammstein live at a Beer Garden (Bierd garden).
Then, Gerald decided to vist a Scholoss(castle) after enjoying this live show.
Gerald had such a busy day, he completely forgot about his bratwurst craving! Maybe a nice slice of apfelkuchen could fill his tummy.
Gerald hopped back in his car hoping he could find some gebaeck on Hauptstrasse.
Unable to find any, he stopped and asked a hund wearing lederhose for directions
The hund stared at him, continued eating its brot, and then walked away.
Unfortunately, the hund had a terrible sense of direction, but instead used his nose to lead Gerald to a doener stand.
The hund challanged Gerald to a doener eating contest though, waking up Gerald's wettbewerbsfaehig spirit!
From there he got the direction need to go back to the Hauptstrasse. Finally, he is able to Raesfeld.
